# Introduction
# ------------
#
# This tutorial will give an introduction to DCGANs through an example. We
# will train a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate new
# celebrities after showing it pictures of many real celebrities. Most of
# the code here is from the dcgan implementation in
# `pytorch/examples <https://github.com/pytorch/examples>`__, and this
# document will give a thorough explanation of the implementation and shed
# light on how and why this model works. But don’t worry, no prior
# knowledge of GANs is required, but it may require a first-timer to spend
# some time reasoning about what is actually happening under the hood.
# Also, for the sake of time it will help to have a GPU, or two. Lets
# start from the beginning.
#
# Generative Adversarial Networks
# -------------------------------
#
# What is a GAN?
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# GANs are a framework for teaching a DL model to capture the training
# data’s distribution so we can generate new data from that same
# distribution. GANs were invented by Ian Goodfellow in 2014 and first
# described in the paper `Generative Adversarial
# Nets <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf>`__.
# They are made of two distinct models, a *generator* and a
# *discriminator*. The job of the generator is to spawn ‘fake’ images that
# look like the training images. The job of the discriminator is to look
# at an image and output whether or not it is a real training image or a
# fake image from the generator. During training, the generator is
# constantly trying to outsmart the discriminator by generating better and
# better fakes, while the discriminator is working to become a better
# detective and correctly classify the real and fake images. The
# equilibrium of this game is when the generator is generating perfect
# fakes that look as if they came directly from the training data, and the
# discriminator is left to always guess at 50% confidence that the
# generator output is real or fake.
#
# Now, lets define some notation to be used throughout tutorial starting
# with the discriminator. Let :math:`x` be data representing an image.
# :math:`D(x)` is the discriminator network which outputs the (scalar)
# probability that :math:`x` came from training data rather than the
# generator. Here, since we are dealing with images the input to
# :math:`D(x)` is an image of CHW size 3x64x64. Intuitively, :math:`D(x)`
# should be HIGH when :math:`x` comes from training data and LOW when
# :math:`x` comes from the generator. :math:`D(x)` can also be thought of
# as a traditional binary classifier.
#
# For the generator’s notation, let :math:`z` be a latent space vector
# sampled from a standard normal distribution. :math:`G(z)` represents the
# generator function which maps the latent vector :math:`z` to data-space.
# The goal of :math:`G` is to estimate the distribution that the training
# data comes from (:math:`p_{data}`) so it can generate fake samples from
# that estimated distribution (:math:`p_g`).
#
# So, :math:`D(G(z))` is the probability (scalar) that the output of the
# generator :math:`G` is a real image. As described in `Goodfellow’s
# paper <https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf>`__,
# :math:`D` and :math:`G` play a minimax game in which :math:`D` tries to
# maximize the probability it correctly classifies reals and fakes
# (:math:`logD(x)`), and :math:`G` tries to minimize the probability that
# :math:`D` will predict its outputs are fake (:math:`log(1-D(G(x)))`).
# From the paper, the GAN loss function is
#
# .. math:: \underset{G}{\text{min}} \underset{D}{\text{max}}V(D,G) = \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p_{data}(x)}\big[logD(x)\big] + \mathbb{E}_{z\sim p_{z}(z)}\big[log(1-D(G(z)))\big]
#
# In theory, the solution to this minimax game is where
# :math:`p_g = p_{data}`, and the discriminator guesses randomly if the
# inputs are real or fake. However, the convergence theory of GANs is
# still being actively researched and in reality models do not always
# train to this point.
#
# What is a DCGAN?
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# A DCGAN is a direct extension of the GAN described above, except that it
# explicitly uses convolutional and convolutional-transpose layers in the
# discriminator and generator, respectively. It was first described by
# Radford et. al. in the paper `Unsupervised Representation Learning With
# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial
# Networks <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf>`__. The discriminator
# is made up of strided
# `convolution <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.Conv2d>`__
# layers, `batch
# norm <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.BatchNorm2d>`__
# layers, and
# `LeakyReLU <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.LeakyReLU>`__
# activations. The input is a 3x64x64 input image and the output is a
# scalar probability that the input is from the real data distribution.
# The generator is comprised of
# `convolutional-transpose <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.ConvTranspose2d>`__
# layers, batch norm layers, and
# `ReLU <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#relu>`__ activations. The
# input is a latent vector, :math:`z`, that is drawn from a standard
# normal distribution and the output is a 3x64x64 RGB image. The strided
# conv-transpose layers allow the latent vector to be transformed into a
# volume with the same shape as an image. In the paper, the authors also
# give some tips about how to setup the optimizers, how to calculate the
# loss functions, and how to initialize the model weights, all of which
# will be explained in the coming sections.

# Inputs
# ------
#
# Let’s define some inputs for the run:
#
# -  **dataroot** - the path to the root of the dataset folder. We will
#    talk more about the dataset in the next section
# -  **workers** - the number of worker threads for loading the data with
#    the DataLoader
# -  **batch_size** - the batch size used in training. The DCGAN paper
#    uses a batch size of 128
# -  **image_size** - the spatial size of the images used for training.
#    This implementation defaults to 64x64. If another size is desired,
#    the structures of D and G must be changed. See
#    `here <https://github.com/pytorch/examples/issues/70>`__ for more
#    details
# -  **nc** - number of color channels in the input images. For color
#    images this is 3
# -  **nz** - length of latent vector
# -  **ngf** - relates to the depth of feature maps carried through the
#    generator
# -  **ndf** - sets the depth of feature maps propagated through the
#    discriminator
# -  **num_epochs** - number of training epochs to run. Training for
#    longer will probably lead to better results but will also take much
#    longer
# -  **lr** - learning rate for training. As described in the DCGAN paper,
#    this number should be 0.0002
# -  **beta1** - beta1 hyperparameter for Adam optimizers. As described in
#    paper, this number should be 0.5
# -  **ngpu** - number of GPUs available. If this is 0, code will run in
#    CPU mode. If this number is greater than 0 it will run on that number
#    of GPUs

    # Data
    # ----
    #
    # In this tutorial we will use the `Celeb-A Faces
    # dataset <http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html>`__ which can
    # be downloaded at the linked site, or in `Google
    # Drive <https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7EVK8r0v71pTUZsaXdaSnZBZzg>`__.
    # The dataset will download as a file named *img_align_celeba.zip*. Once
    # downloaded, create a directory named *celeba* and extract the zip file
    # into that directory. Then, set the *dataroot* input for this notebook to
    # the *celeba* directory you just created. The resulting directory
    # structure should be:
    #
    # ::
    #
    #    /path/to/celeba
    #        -> img_align_celeba
    #            -> 188242.jpg
    #            -> 173822.jpg
    #            -> 284702.jpg
    #            -> 537394.jpg
    #               ...
    #
    # This is an important step because we will be using the ImageFolder
    # dataset class, which requires there to be subdirectories in the

    #
    # From the DCGAN paper, the authors specify that all model weights shall
    # be randomly initialized from a Normal distribution with mean=0,

    # input and reinitializes all convolutional, convolutional-transpose, and
    # batch normalization layers to meet this criteria. This function is
    # applied to the models immediately after initialization.

    def setLossAndOptimizer(self):
        ######################################################################
        # Loss Functions and Optimizers
        # ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        #
        # With :math:`D` and :math:`G` setup, we can specify how they learn
        # through the loss functions and optimizers. We will use the Binary Cross
        # Entropy loss
        # (`BCELoss <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#torch.nn.BCELoss>`__)
        # function which is defined in PyTorch as:
        #
        # .. math:: \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad l_n = - \left[ y_n \cdot \log x_n + (1 - y_n) \cdot \log (1 - x_n) \right]
        #
        # Notice how this function provides the calculation of both log components
        # in the objective function (i.e. :math:`log(D(x))` and
        # :math:`log(1-D(G(z)))`). We can specify what part of the BCE equation to
        # use with the :math:`y` input. This is accomplished in the training loop
        # which is coming up soon, but it is important to understand how we can
        # choose which component we wish to calculate just by changing :math:`y`
        # (i.e. GT labels).
        #
        # Next, we define our real label as 1 and the fake label as 0. These
        # labels will be used when calculating the losses of :math:`D` and
        # :math:`G`, and this is also the convention used in the original GAN
        # paper. Finally, we set up two separate optimizers, one for :math:`D` and
        # one for :math:`G`. As specified in the DCGAN paper, both are Adam
        # optimizers with learning rate 0.0002 and Beta1 = 0.5. For keeping track
        # of the generator’s learning progression, we will generate a fixed batch
        # of latent vectors that are drawn from a Gaussian distribution
        # (i.e. fixed_noise) . In the training loop, we will periodically input
        # this fixed_noise into :math:`G`, and over the iterations we will see
        # images form out of the noise.
        #

        # Initialize BCELoss function
        self.criterion = nn.BCELoss()

        # Create batch of latent vectors that we will use to visualize
        #  the progression of the generator
        # 这里产生一个固定的噪声，每轮学习完成后都使用固定噪声来进行输出
        self.fixed_noise = torch.randn(25, nz, 1, 1, device=self.device)

        # Establish convention for real and fake labels during training
        self.real_label = 1.
        self.fake_label = 0.

        # Setup Adam optimizers for both G and D
        self.optimizerD = optim.Adam(self.netD.parameters(), lr=lr, betas=(beta1, 0.999))
        self.optimizerG = optim.Adam(self.netG.parameters(), lr=lr, betas=(beta1, 0.999))

    def train(self):
        ######################################################################
        # Training
        # ~~~~~~~~
        #
        # Finally, now that we have all of the parts of the GAN framework defined,
        # we can train it. Be mindful that training GANs is somewhat of an art
        # form, as incorrect hyperparameter settings lead to mode collapse with
        # little explanation of what went wrong. Here, we will closely follow
        # Algorithm 1 from Goodfellow’s paper, while abiding by some of the best
        # practices shown in `ganhacks <https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks>`__.
        # Namely, we will “construct different mini-batches for real and fake”
        # images, and also adjust G’s objective function to maximize
        # :math:`logD(G(z))`. Training is split up into two main parts. Part 1
        # updates the Discriminator and Part 2 updates the Generator.
        #
        # **Part 1 - Train the Discriminator**
        #
        # Recall, the goal of training the discriminator is to maximize the
        # probability of correctly classifying a given input as real or fake. In
        # terms of Goodfellow, we wish to “update the discriminator by ascending
        # its stochastic gradient”. Practically, we want to maximize
        # :math:`log(D(x)) + log(1-D(G(z)))`. Due to the separate mini-batch
        # suggestion from ganhacks, we will calculate this in two steps. First, we
        # will construct a batch of real samples from the training set, forward
        # pass through :math:`D`, calculate the loss (:math:`log(D(x))`), then
        # calculate the gradients in a backward pass. Secondly, we will construct
        # a batch of fake samples with the current generator, forward pass this
        # batch through :math:`D`, calculate the loss (:math:`log(1-D(G(z)))`),
        # and *accumulate* the gradients with a backward pass. Now, with the
        # gradients accumulated from both the all-real and all-fake batches, we
        # call a step of the Discriminator’s optimizer.
        #
        # **Part 2 - Train the Generator**
        #
        # As stated in the original paper, we want to train the Generator by
        # minimizing :math:`log(1-D(G(z)))` in an effort to generate better fakes.
        # As mentioned, this was shown by Goodfellow to not provide sufficient
        # gradients, especially early in the learning process. As a fix, we
        # instead wish to maximize :math:`log(D(G(z)))`. In the code we accomplish
        # this by: classifying the Generator output from Part 1 with the
        # Discriminator, computing G’s loss *using real labels as GT*, computing
        # G’s gradients in a backward pass, and finally updating G’s parameters
        # with an optimizer step. It may seem counter-intuitive to use the real
        # labels as GT labels for the loss function, but this allows us to use the
        # :math:`log(x)` part of the BCELoss (rather than the :math:`log(1-x)`
        # part) which is exactly what we want.
        #
        # Finally, we will do some statistic reporting and at the end of each
        # epoch we will push our fixed_noise batch through the generator to
        # visually track the progress of G’s training. The training statistics
        # reported are:
        #
        # -  **Loss_D** - discriminator loss calculated as the sum of losses for
        #    the all real and all fake batches (:math:`log(D(x)) + log(D(G(z)))`).
        # -  **Loss_G** - generator loss calculated as :math:`log(D(G(z)))`
        # -  **D(x)** - the average output (across the batch) of the discriminator
        #    for the all real batch. This should start close to 1 then
        #    theoretically converge to 0.5 when G gets better. Think about why
        #    this is.
        # -  **D(G(z))** - average discriminator outputs for the all fake batch.
        #    The first number is before D is updated and the second number is
        #    after D is updated. These numbers should start near 0 and converge to
        #    0.5 as G gets better. Think about why this is.
        #
        # **Note:** This step might take a while, depending on how many epochs you
        # run and if you removed some data from the dataset.

        # We have reached the end of our journey, but there are several places you
        # could go from here. You could:
        #
        # -  Train for longer to see how good the results get
        # -  Modify this model to take a different dataset and possibly change the
        #    size of the images and the model architecture
        # -  Check out some other cool GAN projects
        #    `here <https://github.com/nashory/gans-awesome-applications>`__
        # -  Create GANs that generate
