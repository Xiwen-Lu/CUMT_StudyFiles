# Generator
# ~~~~~~~~~
#
# The generator, :math:`G`, is designed to map the latent space vector
# (:math:`z`) to data-space. Since our data are images, converting
# :math:`z` to data-space means ultimately creating a RGB image with the
# same size as the training images (i.e. 3x64x64). In practice, this is
# accomplished through a series of strided two dimensional convolutional
# transpose layers, each paired with a 2d batch norm layer and a relu
# activation. The output of the generator is fed through a tanh function
# to return it to the input data range of :math:`[-1,1]`. It is worth
# noting the existence of the batch norm functions after the
# conv-transpose layers, as this is a critical contribution of the DCGAN
# paper. These layers help with the flow of gradients during training. An
# image of the generator from the DCGAN paper is shown below.

#
# Notice, the how the inputs we set in the input section (*nz*, *ngf*, and
# *nc*) influence the generator architecture in code. *nz* is the length
# of the z input vector, *ngf* relates to the size of the feature maps
# that are propagated through the generator, and *nc* is the number of
# channels in the output image (set to 3 for RGB images). Below is the
# code for the generator.

# Discriminator
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# As mentioned, the discriminator, :math:`D`, is a binary classification
# network that takes an image as input and outputs a scalar probability
# that the input image is real (as opposed to fake). Here, :math:`D` takes
# a 3x64x64 input image, processes it through a series of Conv2d,
# BatchNorm2d, and LeakyReLU layers, and outputs the final probability
# through a Sigmoid activation function. This architecture can be extended
# with more layers if necessary for the problem, but there is significance
# to the use of the strided convolution, BatchNorm, and LeakyReLUs. The
# DCGAN paper mentions it is a good practice to use strided convolution
# rather than pooling to downsample because it lets the network learn its
# own pooling function. Also batch norm and leaky relu functions promote
# healthy gradient flow which is critical for the learning process of both
# :math:`G` and :math:`D`.
